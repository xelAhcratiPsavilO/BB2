### Define 'Feature Test'

Features are changes that add new functionality or significantly modify existing functionality.

Hence, Feature Test is the test of those changes.

One way to do feature testing is through a REPL (read-eval-print-loop), an interactive environment that takes single user inputs, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user.

You can see an example of Feature Test in the following [section](irb.md).
